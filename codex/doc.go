// Package codex provides a Go SDK for interacting with OpenAI's codex CLI.
//
// Similar to the official OpenAI TypeScript SDK, this package allows developers
// to integrate codex capabilities into their Go applications. Please be aware
// that this SDK is unofficial and not endorsed by OpenAI, but it aims to
// provide a similar level of functionality and ease of use.
